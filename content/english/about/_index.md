# Alfons Mu√±oz

As a technology enthusiast, I specialize in helping people and companies to improve and grow through the functional use of technology. I am also fond of electronics and the IoT. For years I have been a technology consultant for various companies, both from inside and outside, helping them in the transition towards the use of modern solutions and transforming the way they work. I enjoy spending time with my family, cycling, traveling, and keeping up with the latest technology trends.
